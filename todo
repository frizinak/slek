[ ] h:     maintain Latest and LastRead between channel, group and im updates
[ ] m:     mark last received message in channels and ims (queued)
[-] m:     vim navigation in box (hjkl / ud)
[-] l:     vim mode in input / editor command
[x] m:     generic commands
[x] m-5:   list channels
[x] m-5:   list users
[x] h:     move username and token to config
[x] l-8:   restart repo and move to github
[x] l:     #/@ /hist amount argument
[x] l:     im notifications
[x] l:     fix 11, don't receive notifications for own ims xD
[x] l:     ratelimit notifications
[ ] h:     fix editor: crashes hard on multiple newlines (paste)
[-] h:     fix editor: arrow down / right should not 'create' newlines (right arrow fixed, newlines: alt+enter?)
[ ] l:     send messages using the rtm api (keep webapi post as fallback?)
[x] l:     user-is-typing box (or generic feedback box, repurposing info for users and channel listings) + timeout
[x] l:     update users / channels status on rtm events instead of webapi every n seconds
[ ] l:     godoc
[ ] l:     logo / notification logo
[ ] l:     configurable notifications (only mentions and ims / all joined channel messages / take slack preferences into account)
[ ] l:     fix ratelimit notifications, currently protects against batches but 2 subsequent mentions will still both trigger a notification.
[ ] l:     fuzzy match more than cmd[0] alone.
[ ] h:     fileupload
[ ] l:     document editorCmd
[ ] l:     document usage
[-] l:     makefile cross compile (gox)
[x] m:     ignore events for channels where isMember == false (slack appears to send reaction events for channels we're not a member of)
[ ] l:     :smile: unicode chars (configurable)
[ ] l:     support mpim/mpdm or at the very least be able to leave them (legacy slack feature?)
[ ] m:     # / @ entity history (up / down key?)
[x] m:     start editor with <C-e>
[ ] l:     implement notifications
